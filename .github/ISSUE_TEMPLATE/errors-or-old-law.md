**Treatise:**
openlex-contract, para 10-11

**Description:**
<!--Describe the error in details, and remember to support any statements of law with legal authority-->
The law as given in *Dunlop* has recently been reformulated by the UKSC in the *Cavendish* case, where at para [xxxx], Lord xxxx sets out the test to be: "xxxxxx"

As such, I recommend that para 10-11 be changed to 'xxxxxxx'
