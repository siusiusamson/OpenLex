# Project OpenLex
Welcome to OpenLex, an open-source and community-based repository for hosting Hong Kong legal treatises.

# Project Vision: A word from the project initiator
> Good things shouldn't be kept in secret. Each year, hundreds of law students struggle to get past their law courses just because they don't have access to notes and materials compiled by their seniors. This probject, initiatied in 2020, is an attempt to solve that problem once and for all. Although at the time of writing this introduction the treatises are nowhere near complete, I have several principles in mind that I think will help you know what this project is about and where this is heading:
> 1. This probject is open-source and community-based--no one, not even me, can claim ownership to any of the contents hosted here.
> 2. This repo is public and free and will remain so for the remainder of its life.
> 3. This is NOT an attempt to reproduce Halsbury or to establish any authority. The only authority lies in the readers--help us check for any mistakes or changes in our project.
>
> Please subscribe to this repository by using the 'watch' button on the top right-hand corner, or give us a 'star' to show us your support.
